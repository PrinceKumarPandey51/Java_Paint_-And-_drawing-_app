🎨 Java Paint Application

Java Paint App — A Lightweight Desktop Drawing Tool Built in Swing

The Java Paint App is a fully interactive drawing application built from scratch using Java Swing and 2D Graphics. Designed to be simple, fast, and beginner-friendly, the app offers a clean interface where users can sketch freely, draw shapes, erase, adjust brush size, pick custom colors, and save their artwork. Inspired by classic tools like MS Paint, this project demonstrates how powerful and flexible Java’s GUI libraries can be when building visual desktop applications.
